# Running Locally

If you prefer to run locally, you will need the latest LTS of Node.js installed as a prerequisite. You can find the download and installation instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/). Be sure to include npm in the installation options!

Once Node.js is available, you can open a terminal (PowerShell, cmd, or otherwise) in this directory and run `npm install`. Once that is complete, run `npm start` to launch the development server in watch mode. This will launch your default browser to the port the development server is running on.

Now you can open the files in the `src` directory in your favorite editor and start hacking! The development server will automatically rebuild and push the changes to the browser. Sometimes the state of the browser can get out of sync though. If you see anything odd or unexeptected try reloading the browser.
